W ciągu pięciu lat działalności brokerzy technologii i analitycy funduszu JCI Venture przeanalizowali prawie 400 zgłoszeń projektów inwestycyjnych, spośród których kilkadziesiąt zostało poddanych pogłębionej analizie i wsparciu w trakcie działań preinkubacyjnych. Pomysłodawcami, którzy otrzymali wsparcie, byli naukowcy na wszelkich szczeblach kariery akademickiej – od studenta do profesora – a także osoby wywodzące się z przemysłu farmaceutycznego. Około 20% środków zostało zaangażowanych w najbardziej ambitne, ale i ryzykowne, przedsięwzięcia związane z biofarmacją i potencjalnie przełomowymi lekami. Podobną kwotę przeznaczono na spółki działające w obszarze bioinżynierii, których produkty, często w fazie prototypów, zdobyły już wiele nagród, a także przyciągnęły zainteresowanie potencjalnych partnerów i mediów. Pozostała część portfela to start-upy komercjalizujące rozwiązania z obszaru chemii, nanotechnologii, wprowadzające na rynek ulepszone formulacje leków, a także usprawniające procesy badań klinicznych. Część powołanych spółek działa na terenie Life Science Parku w Krakowie i korzysta z jego infrastruktury. Pozostałe zlokalizowane są głównie w dużych ośrodkach akademickich na terenie całego kraju. Aktualnie zespół funduszu koncentruje się na wspieraniu spółek portfelowych poprzez poszukiwanie klientów i inwestorów gotowych nabyć rozwinięte technologie lub współfinansować ich dalszy rozwój, a także angażuje się w ich działalność operacyjną. W skład portfela inwestycyjnego JCI Venture Sp. z o.o. wchodzą m.in. • EGZOTECH Sp. z o.o., opracowująca roboty i egzoszkielety wykorzystywane w rehabilitacji, spółka wielokrotnie nagradzana na arenie krajowej i międzynarodowej, • F1 Pharma Sp. z o.o., na bazie kilkuosobowego zespołu założycielskiego realizuje procesy badawczo-rozwojowe dla dużych klientów farmaceutycznych z kraju i zagranicy, • PRODROMUS Sp. z o.o., rozwijająca projekt robota umożliwiającego naukę chodu przez niepełnosprawne dzieci, której pomysłodawca zdobył m.in. tytuł Zwykłego Bohatera.", +48 12 297 46 29,

We're not a VC ;) We're a team of deep tech founders who clearly see applications such as AI/ML and blockchain to sectors such as medicine, health, education, agriculture, climate, etc., are going to thrive in the new world. Everyone is waiting for things to go back to normal. However, we have conviction that we are already living in the new normal and we are willing to put our money where our mouth is. Deep Ventures wants to invest in hundreds of startups. As founders ourselves, we can only start one company at a time (unless we become Elon Musk or Jack Dorsey), but there are going to be thousands of great companies born during this time. They just need to be very capital efficient. For example, India has some of the most talented developers in the world. IIT pumps out engineering grads like crazy. They also love to compete. Cost of living is relatively cheap compared to the western world so they can simply get a lot more done with little cash. As talent is equally distributed, we have found this to be true across South East Asia, Africa, Mexico, South America, and even many cities in the US. It may be a good model to have a Bay Area HQ with engineering offshore. We would love to back founders who know how to live in this arbitrage. We are engineers and coders first. We are technical. We have probably faced all the technical challenges founders come across from software to hardware. Stuck on a Rails app debug for days? Need to scale to 600M users smoothly? Looking to train huge AI/ML datasets that typically takes weeks, but you can't wait? Want to start a smart hardware product from scratch and modularize it to work the supply chain? We got you.

Our processes are interwoven by shared technology that can be iterated by teams across parallel internal portfolio companies. Working together, we leverage our collective creativity, expertise, and experience to generate ideas, reduce risk and accelerate the creation of new disruptive technologies. 

Classical Venture Capital typically invests in entrepreneurship that is performed in isolation within a single venture. Ambistar Ventures shuns this approach so that our entrepreneurs may tackle problems in concert within a team of innovators utilizing shared best practices. This transformation allows solopreneurs or small teams to quickly advance the creation of their ventures and dramatically reduce early-stage startup risk.

Disruptive Technologies
Web Innovations
